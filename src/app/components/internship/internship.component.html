                            An internship is a professional learning experience that offers meaningful, practical work
                            related to a studentâ€™s field of study or career interest. An internship gives a student the
                            opportunity for career exploration and development, and to learn new skills. It offers the
                            employer the opportunity to bring new ideas and energy into the workplace, develop talent
                            and potentially build a pipeline for future full-time employees.
